<p>Nothing left here. What are you doing? Don’t you know the further you continue, the less chance all of this ends? You don’t want that. None of us want that... There’s no reason to still be here. You’re wasting your own time. Why, when you could be doing so much more? Is any of this... really worth it? The answer... Well... I needn’t continue.</p>
